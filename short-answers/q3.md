# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
```nums.forEach(printDouble());``` should be ```nums.forEach(printDouble)```. 

The ```.forEach()``` method expects a function as its argument, but here, we are calling printDouble immediately instead of passing it as a reference.
