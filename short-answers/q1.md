# Question
What is a Higher Order Function?

# Answer
A higher order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result. The methods ```.map()```, ```.filter()```, and ```.reduce()``` are examples of higher order functions. 

# Teacher Feedback

This is true, however most developers will call .map, .filter, .reduce a higher order method rather than a function. We will probably talk about this more in the future but basically a method is a function that belongs to an object, in this case it is a method that is specific to the Array javascript object.
